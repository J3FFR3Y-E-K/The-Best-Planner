2/24 Norke: Added all initial website files, including image file for logo

2/27 Ian: Changed all website files to php (originals are being kept as baseline) and added login and signup pages. Also implemented login system using php pages and a database. All websites are now live through https://cyan.csam.montclair.edu/~lovei1/ and no page besides login and signup are available to those who aren't logged in. Along with this I uploaded to the GitHub a txt document with the SQL code of the users database with 2 users already in it


3/2 Cristian: Stress tested https://cyan.csam.montclair.edu/~lovei1/ to check how many users it would take for the system to crash. During the stress test it was found that the system can perfectly handle under 400 users. After the 400 threshold the system begins to have issues. 10,000 user loads were tested but the system started failing after 2,000 users.
