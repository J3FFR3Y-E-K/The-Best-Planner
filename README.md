2/24 Norke: Added all initial website files, including image file for logo

2/27 Ian: Changed all website files to php (originals are being kept as baseline) and added login and signup pages. Also implemented login system using php pages and a database. All websites are now live through https://cyan.csam.montclair.edu/~lovei1/ and no page besides login and signup are available to those who aren't logged in. Along with this I uploaded to the GitHub a txt document with the SQL code of the users database with 2 users already in it


3/2 Cristian: Stress tested https://cyan.csam.montclair.edu/~lovei1/ to check how many users it would take for the system to crash.
