Her talk will explore the historical conditions of Mozart\u2019s time, examine counter-stories that challenge the opera\u2019s embedded \u201c-isms,\u201d and consider recent interpretive approaches that reframe the work for contemporary audiences. Coppola will also address the creative choices audiences will encounter in the upcoming Cali Opera production, emphasizing the value of intentional, ongoing engagement with this complex and enduring work. \n About the Speaker Catherine Coppola  is Chair of the Thomas Hunter Honors Program at Hunter College (CUNY) and a scholar of opera, canon formation, and pedagogy. Her work appears in leading collections on Mozart and Beethoven, and her forthcoming book,  Teaching Canonic Opera and Musical Theater with Intention  (Routledge, 2026), has been widely praised for its critical insight and practical impact. \n About the Sacher Distinguished Lecture The Sacher Distinguished Lecture in Music is an annual event at the John J.

Through performance and commentary, the program examines Spirituals as songs born from bondage that continue to resonate across cultural and musical boundaries. \n Dr. Clonts is an active performer across opera, gospel, and art song, with appearances at Cincinnati Opera, The Atlanta Opera, The Princeton Festival, and Indiana University Opera Theater. He currently serves on the voice faculty at the John J. Cali School of Music at Montclair State University and William Paterson University, maintains a private studio, and lectures nationally on opera and African American music. \n Open to the public.

    "description": "Experience two distinct works by acclaimed songwriter and performer Gabriel Kahane in one unforgettable day.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n In this duo of intimate solo musical plays, composer Gabriel Kahane blends songwriting and storytelling for a singular, poignant theatrical event. Book of Travelers recounts the strangers he met on a 9,000-mile train journey through a divided America, and Magnificent Bird chronicles a year he spent entirely off-line, and the unexpected turbulence of living quietly. Performed on alternating nights, these two concept albums offer a relentless self-inquiry, and a searing portrait of a world in flux.\u00a0 To join us, be sure to pick up your free student ticket from the Alexander Kasser Theatre box office or our mobile box office in the student center lobby, Tuesday - Thursday, 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and show your student ID at the PEAK desk in the lobby when you arrive for a surprise gift from PEAK. \n \u00a0 \n Hailed as \u201cone of the finest songwriters of the day\u201d by The New Yorker, Gabriel Kahane is a musician and storyteller whose work spans the theater, club, and concert hall. Highlights of the 2024-25 season include a return to the New York stage in a production at Playwrights Horizons, performances at the Philharmonie de Paris, Wigmore Hall, and the Concertgebouw with fellow composer/performer Caroline Shaw, the premiere of a clarinet concerto for Anthony McGill, a solo debut with the Orchestre National de Lyon, and Kahane\u2019s San Francisco conducting debut in Carla Kihlstedt\u2019s Twenty-six Little Deaths. Kahane's collaborators range from Phoebe Bridgers, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, and Sylvan Esso, to the Danish String Quartet, Roomful of Teeth, and Attacca Quartet. As a writer, he has been published by The New Yorker online and The New York Times; a newsletter and collection of essays on music, literature, and politics can be found at\u00a0 gabrielkahane.substack.com . \n \u00a0 \n 4:00 pm Magnificent Bird \n Run Time: \u00a074 minutes, no intermission. \n \u00a0 \n Magnificent Bird, is an intimate reflection on a year of self-imposed isolation during which the artist set out to write a song every day. With contributions from Andrew Bird, Chris Thile, Amelia Meath (Sylvan Esso), and Pulitzer Prize- winning composer Caroline Shaw, this collection explores the delicate balance between personal introspection and global crises. It\u2019s a vivid musical snapshot of life during a tumultuous period, offering both a personal and universal meditation on modern-day existence. Based on Kahane\u2019s fifth LP. \n \u00a0 \n 7:00 pm - Book of Travelers \n Run Time: \u00a070 minutes, no intermission \n \u00a0 \n In Book of Travelers, Gabriel Kahane embarks on a journey across the United States, exploring the intersections of American identity and personal connection through the people he meets along the way. This powerful and emotional piece blends folk, classical, and pop influences to create a nuanced reflection on contemporary life in America. The work is a poignant and intimate exploration of what it means to traverse a country at a crossroads."

This is a unique opportunity for the MSU community to engage directly with issues shaping law, advocacy, and prevention efforts across the state. \n This year\u2019s theme,  \u201cHuman Trafficking at the Intersection of Sports,\u201d  examines the often-overlooked risks connected to major sporting events. From labor exploitation in construction, hospitality, and event operations to increased vulnerabilities during large-scale tournaments, the conversation moves beyond headlines to focus on evidence-based policy responses and accountability. \n Last year\u2019s sold-out breakfast featured nationally recognized experts, survivor leaders, and New Jersey legislators\u2014and this year\u2019s program promises equally compelling dialogue and actionable insights. Students and staff alike are encouraged to attend, learn, and be part of a growing campus-wide commitment to prevention, awareness, and informed action.

From early patent law and land-grant universities to federally funded research and the modern innovation economy, this lecture explores how public policy has structured incentives for discovery and dissemination of knowledge. Particular attention is given to universities as engines of research, talent development, and public purpose, operating at the intersection of academic freedom and national priorities. Participants will be asked to consider how evolving partnerships between government and higher education advance the common good and fuel America\u2019s capacity for innovation."

While government administrators are often derided as inefficient or even obstructionist, technocrats are responsible for making government work and offer policy continuity and expertise across administrations. Still, the growth of a large permanent bureaucracy challenges the notion of accountability grounded in democratic elections. By tracing historical developments and contemporary debates, this lecture focuses on the centrality of government administrative capacity in the American experiment, focusing on the tensions and collaboration between elected officials and professional bureaucrats. We will consider the role of independent government agencies that were established with the idea of partitioning regulatory functions from partisan pressure."
