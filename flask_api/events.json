    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

Grounded in the idea that lasting change begins at the roots, this event encourages reflection, conversation, and connection around personal and collective power. \n \u00a0 \n Through engaging prompts and hands-on activities, students will examine the issues they care about most, how those issues connect to their communities, and the ways civic participation\u2014like voting, advocacy, and dialogue\u2014can turn values into action. Whether you\u2019re deeply engaged or just beginning to explore your civic voice, Rooted in Power meets you where you are. \n \u00a0 \n \u2728  What to Expect: \n \n \n Interactive prompts to reflect on values, identity, and community \n \n \n Opportunities to explore how personal experiences connect to civic power \n \n \n Nonpartisan resources to learn how change happens at the local level \n \n \n A welcoming, judgment-free space for conversation and curiosity \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Rooted in Power  reminds us that power isn\u2019t just something we see\u2014it\u2019s something we grow, nurture, and use together."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

Cali School of Music ,  Montclair State University Admission:  Free and open to the public \n The Sacher Distinguished Lecture in Music is an annual event at the John J. Cali School of Music that features innovative scholarship about music as a cultural form. The lecture takes place in Leshowitz Recital Hall and is free and open to the public. \n This year\u2019s lecture,  Power and Vulnerability in Mozart\u2019s  Magic Flute  and Requiem Mass , explores how these two landmark works reveal contrasting and overlapping ideas of authority, emotion, and human fragility. \n Within the span of just a few months in 1791, Mozart completed the opera that would become one of the most performed worldwide and began work on the Requiem that remains a staple of choral performance. Though geared toward different audiences \u2014 secular and sacred \u2014 both works illuminate shared themes of vulnerability and power. This talk examines how gender, class, and race are intertwined with who gets to wield power, historically and today; considers counter-stories within the works that critique their assumptions; and surveys recent stagings to contextualize creative choices in the Cali Opera production. \n Operatic in emotional depth, the Requiem offers another perspective on vulnerability in the face of power \u2014 not the power of rulers in  The Magic Flute , but the divine, expressed in the  Rex Tremendae  in G minor, a key Mozart reserved for especially charged emotional expression. The lecture concludes with how such awareness can deepen authentic performance and interpretation of both works. \n About the Speaker Catherine Coppola is Chair of the Thomas Hunter Honors Program at Hunter College (CUNY) and a scholar of opera, canon formation, and pedagogy. Her work appears in leading collections on Mozart and Beethoven. Her forthcoming book,  Teaching Canonic Opera and Musical Theater with Intention  (Routledge, 2026), has been widely praised for its critical insight and practical impact."

This is a unique opportunity for the MSU community to engage directly with issues shaping law, advocacy, and prevention efforts across the state. \n This year\u2019s theme,  \u201cHuman Trafficking at the Intersection of Sports,\u201d  examines the often-overlooked risks connected to major sporting events. From labor exploitation in construction, hospitality, and event operations to increased vulnerabilities during large-scale tournaments, the conversation moves beyond headlines to focus on evidence-based policy responses and accountability. \n Last year\u2019s sold-out breakfast featured nationally recognized experts, survivor leaders, and New Jersey legislators\u2014and this year\u2019s program promises equally compelling dialogue and actionable insights.

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "The emergence of a highly competent bureaucracy is typically under appreciated, if not ignored, as an ingredient in the emergence of the American experiment. While government administrators are often derided as inefficient or even obstructionist, technocrats are responsible for making government work and offer policy continuity and expertise across administrations. Still, the growth of a large permanent bureaucracy challenges the notion of accountability grounded in democratic elections. By tracing historical developments and contemporary debates, this lecture focuses on the centrality of government administrative capacity in the American experiment, focusing on the tensions and collaboration between elected officials and professional bureaucrats. We will consider the role of independent government agencies that were established with the idea of partitioning regulatory functions from partisan pressure."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."
