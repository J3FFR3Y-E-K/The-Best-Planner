Cali School of Music, Montclair State University \n This faculty recital and lecture on Spirituals, presented by  Darian Clonts , invites audiences into a thoughtful exploration of how singers can ethically and responsibly perform this uniquely powerful and authentically American repertoire. \n The evening will feature a performance by Dr. Clonts alongside select undergraduate students from the Cali School of Music, combining live music with critical reflection on history, context, and interpretation. Through performance and commentary, the program examines Spirituals as songs born from bondage that continue to resonate across cultural and musical boundaries. \n Dr. Clonts is an active performer across opera, gospel, and art song, with appearances at Cincinnati Opera, The Atlanta Opera, The Princeton Festival, and Indiana University Opera Theater. He currently serves on the voice faculty at the John J. Cali School of Music at Montclair State University and William Paterson University, maintains a private studio, and lectures nationally on opera and African American music. \n Open to the public.

Her work is painting-based but utilizes a wide variety of media and participatory strategies to explore several reoccurring themes such as the social and ecological implications of the picturesque, the revolutionary potential of nostalgia, the conflict between advertising and ornament in public space, the relationship between art and tourism and the role of art and the artist in our society. \n \u00a0 \n Harvey\u2019s work frequently centers the viewer, allowing members of the public to actively participate by submitting their ideas. For The Utopia Machine she has been painting patent drawings based on utopias submitted by members of the public. Her other on-going project The Disappointed Tourist, for which she has been painting lost sites suggested by members of the public, formed the centerpiece of a survey show that recently travelled to various countries. \n \u00a0 \n Her latest, installation The Disappointed Tourist is currently on view at the Chicago Architecture Center. Her new outdoor installation Winter in the Summer House is currently on view at Olana. Ellen lives and works in Brooklyn and is represented by Locks Gallery (Philadelphia) and Meessen Gallery (Brussels, Belgium). \n \u00a0 \n This speaker series is free and open to the public. \n \u00a0 \n \ud83d\udcc5 Art Forum \n Monday, 2/2/26\u00a0 5:20pm-7pm \n Calcia Hall, Room 140"

Tracing this relationship from the founding era through major economic transformations, social movements, and political reforms, this lecture examines how markets have both supported and strained democratic ideals of equality, liberty, and self-government. The lecture will consider pivotal debates over regulation, labor, innovation, and inequality, highlighting moments when democratic institutions reshaped capitalism \u2013 and when economic power challenged democratic accountability. Participants will be invited to reflect on what this evolving relationship means for the future of democratic governance in the United States."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "Experience two distinct works by acclaimed songwriter and performer Gabriel Kahane in one unforgettable day.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n In this duo of intimate solo musical plays, composer Gabriel Kahane blends songwriting and storytelling for a singular, poignant theatrical event. Book of Travelers recounts the strangers he met on a 9,000-mile train journey through a divided America, and Magnificent Bird chronicles a year he spent entirely off-line, and the unexpected turbulence of living quietly. Performed on alternating nights, these two concept albums offer a relentless self-inquiry, and a searing portrait of a world in flux.\u00a0 To join us, be sure to pick up your free student ticket from the Alexander Kasser Theatre box office or our mobile box office in the student center lobby, Tuesday - Thursday, 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and show your student ID at the PEAK desk in the lobby when you arrive for a surprise gift from PEAK. \n \u00a0 \n Hailed as \u201cone of the finest songwriters of the day\u201d by The New Yorker, Gabriel Kahane is a musician and storyteller whose work spans the theater, club, and concert hall. Highlights of the 2024-25 season include a return to the New York stage in a production at Playwrights Horizons, performances at the Philharmonie de Paris, Wigmore Hall, and the Concertgebouw with fellow composer/performer Caroline Shaw, the premiere of a clarinet concerto for Anthony McGill, a solo debut with the Orchestre National de Lyon, and Kahane\u2019s San Francisco conducting debut in Carla Kihlstedt\u2019s Twenty-six Little Deaths. Kahane's collaborators range from Phoebe Bridgers, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, and Sylvan Esso, to the Danish String Quartet, Roomful of Teeth, and Attacca Quartet. As a writer, he has been published by The New Yorker online and The New York Times; a newsletter and collection of essays on music, literature, and politics can be found at\u00a0 gabrielkahane.substack.com . \n \u00a0 \n 4:00 pm Magnificent Bird \n Run Time: \u00a074 minutes, no intermission. \n \u00a0 \n Magnificent Bird, is an intimate reflection on a year of self-imposed isolation during which the artist set out to write a song every day. With contributions from Andrew Bird, Chris Thile, Amelia Meath (Sylvan Esso), and Pulitzer Prize- winning composer Caroline Shaw, this collection explores the delicate balance between personal introspection and global crises. It\u2019s a vivid musical snapshot of life during a tumultuous period, offering both a personal and universal meditation on modern-day existence. Based on Kahane\u2019s fifth LP. \n \u00a0 \n 7:00 pm - Book of Travelers \n Run Time: \u00a070 minutes, no intermission \n \u00a0 \n In Book of Travelers, Gabriel Kahane embarks on a journey across the United States, exploring the intersections of American identity and personal connection through the people he meets along the way. This powerful and emotional piece blends folk, classical, and pop influences to create a nuanced reflection on contemporary life in America. The work is a poignant and intimate exploration of what it means to traverse a country at a crossroads."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

This is a unique opportunity for the MSU community to engage directly with issues shaping law, advocacy, and prevention efforts across the state. \n This year\u2019s theme,  \u201cHuman Trafficking at the Intersection of Sports,\u201d  examines the often-overlooked risks connected to major sporting events. From labor exploitation in construction, hospitality, and event operations to increased vulnerabilities during large-scale tournaments, the conversation moves beyond headlines to focus on evidence-based policy responses and accountability. \n Last year\u2019s sold-out breakfast featured nationally recognized experts, survivor leaders, and New Jersey legislators\u2014and this year\u2019s program promises equally compelling dialogue and actionable insights. Students and staff alike are encouraged to attend, learn, and be part of a growing campus-wide commitment to prevention, awareness, and informed action.

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "The emergence of a highly competent bureaucracy is typically under appreciated, if not ignored, as an ingredient in the emergence of the American experiment. While government administrators are often derided as inefficient or even obstructionist, technocrats are responsible for making government work and offer policy continuity and expertise across administrations. Still, the growth of a large permanent bureaucracy challenges the notion of accountability grounded in democratic elections. By tracing historical developments and contemporary debates, this lecture focuses on the centrality of government administrative capacity in the American experiment, focusing on the tensions and collaboration between elected officials and professional bureaucrats. We will consider the role of independent government agencies that were established with the idea of partitioning regulatory functions from partisan pressure."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."
