Cali School of Music at Montclair State University and the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, following appointments at the Juilliard School and the City University of New York. \n A versatile performer, Mr. Hobbs is equally at home with the core classics of the canon and adventurous in exploring new musics. He can be heard in recordings of music by Lowell Liebermann, Xavier Montsalvage, and Dave Soldier, among others.\u00a0 \n His debut CD, \u201cOrbiting Garden: Music of Hatzis and Sorabji,\u201d was released Summer 2025 on Blue Griffin Records.

    "description": "Art Forum is a speaker series featuring artists, designers, art historians, curators, and art critics from around the world presenting their work and ideas in an open forum, hosted by the Department of Art & Design. Artist and curator Ari Melenciano will discuss her latest work in  The Age of Black Metal  by Afrotectopia.  Register on Eventbrite \n \n \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE EXHIBITION \n September 23 \u2013 December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Curated by Ari Melenciano \n Black Metal  originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way. \n The Age of Black Metal  invites all to imagine the futures that Black culture can build, if given space to expand without limit. \n Ari Melenciano  has cultivated an expansive practice within the arts, technology, design, culture, and pedagogy. Her natural ability to combine many disciplines reveals their interconnectedness and reimagines their conventions for new possibilities. Her art practice ranges from using AI through both critical and imaginative lenses, to sound design using botanical data. Her work has been exhibited around the world from Dubai's Museum of the Future to the Studio Museum in Harlem. She's a frequent international public speaker, and occasionally designs and teaches courses at New York University, Hunter College, Parsons, and the Pratt Institute. \n Afrotectopia  is a social institution cultivating boundless innovation at the nexus of art, design, technology, and culture. Founded in 2018 by NYU ITP graduate student Ari Melenciano, Afrotectopia began as a highly cross-disciplinary conference cultivating a vibrant community of industry and cultural pioneers. For years, Afrotectopia hosted a variety of programming that bridged connections between emerging technologies, Black culture, and racial equity."

After all, the brain is the seat of consciousness. But Fred Dretske thinks things aren\u2019t so simple. He\u2019s no dualist; he doesn\u2019t think that people have immaterial souls; and he has a deep respect for modern science. However, in his view, trying to better understand consciousness by looking more closely at the brain is something like trying to better understand the story of  Alice in Wonderland  by taking a microscope to the ink in which the story is written. Each involves looking in the wrong place. In this P4L, we\u2019ll try to make sense of what Dretske is getting at and why he thinks the brain is the wrong place to look for consciousness (or, at least, certain aspects of consciousness). \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 What is P4L? Students, professors, and other philosophy enthusiasts close-read and discuss a few great passages of philosophy. \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 Who\u2019s invited? No preparation or previous knowledge of philosophy is needed. Everyone is welcome! \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 Should I bring anything? Bring a beverage, and if you're hungry, bring your actual lunch."

    "description": "Join us in celebrating the opening of the Montclair State University Galleries' Fall 2025 exhibition:\u00a0 The Age of Black Metal by  Afrotectopia. Remarks by the artist and curator Ari Melenciano and Dean Gurskis at 6 pm in the\u00a0 Segal Gallery , located on the fourth floor of the Red Hawk Deck.\u00a0 Register for free here! \n ABOUT THE EXHIBITION \n September 23 \u2013 December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Black Metal  originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way. \n The Age of Black Metal  invites all to imagine the futures that Black culture can build, if given space to expand without limit. \n Ari Melenciano  has cultivated an expansive practice within the arts, technology, design, culture, and pedagogy. Her natural ability to combine many disciplines reveals their interconnectedness and reimagines their conventions for new possibilities. Her art practice ranges from using AI through both critical and imaginative lenses, to sound design using botanical data. Her work has been exhibited around the world from Dubai's Museum of the Future to the Studio Museum in Harlem. She's a frequent international public speaker, and occasionally designs and teaches courses at New York University, Hunter College, Parsons, and the Pratt Institute. \n Afrotectopia  is a social institution cultivating boundless innovation at the nexus of art, design, technology, and culture. Founded in 2018 by NYU ITP graduate student Ari Melenciano, Afrotectopia began as a highly cross-disciplinary conference cultivating a vibrant community of industry and cultural pioneers. For years, Afrotectopia hosted a variety of programming that bridged connections between emerging technologies, Black culture, and racial equity."

No registration necessary. \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n ABOUT THE EXHIBITION \n September 23 \u2013 December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Black Metal  originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way. \n The Age of Black Metal  invites all to imagine the futures that Black culture can build, if given space to expand without limit. \n Ari Melenciano  has cultivated an expansive practice within the arts, technology, design, culture, and pedagogy. Her natural ability to combine many disciplines reveals their interconnectedness and reimagines their conventions for new possibilities. Her art practice ranges from using AI through both critical and imaginative lenses, to sound design using botanical data. Her work has been exhibited around the world from Dubai's Museum of the Future to the Studio Museum in Harlem. She's a frequent international public speaker, and occasionally designs and teaches courses at New York University, Hunter College, Parsons, and the Pratt Institute. \n Afrotectopia  is a social institution cultivating boundless innovation at the nexus of art, design, technology, and culture. Founded in 2018 by NYU ITP graduate student Ari Melenciano, Afrotectopia began as a highly cross-disciplinary conference cultivating a vibrant community of industry and cultural pioneers. For years, Afrotectopia hosted a variety of programming that bridged connections between emerging technologies, Black culture, and racial equity."

She has choreographed productions such as Sri: In Search of the Goddess (2000), Ansh (2006), Sacred Space (2006), and Ahuti (2018), blending traditional Odissi techniques with contemporary themes. Under Sen\u2019s direction, Nrityagram has performed at international venues, including the Joyce Theater, Jacob\u2019s Pillow Dance Festival, Edinburgh International Festival, and Skirball Center in New York, earning recognition for precision and emotional depth. She has performed in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Europe, Sri Lanka, and countries in the Far East. \n Uttara Asha Coorlawala is a professor of dance at Barnard College and the Curator of the Erasing Borders festival of Indian Dance in New York City. She is interested in bridges between theory and practice, and on re-circulations of movement through time and cultures. Her writings about the qualities of 'Indianness' in dance, have served as criteria at the international performance level. Within the field of dance studies, she served on the Editorial Board of Dance Research Journal, and as a panelist for New York, Ohio, and Maryland State Arts Councils. She also served as an advisor to then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and as Dance Director of the National Center for Performing Arts, in Mumbai. In 2011, Coorlawala was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Puruskar Award, India\u2019s highest award in the Performing Arts. \n Odissi\u00a0(\u0b13\u0b21\u0b3c\u0b3f\u0b36\u0b40) also referred to as\u00a0Orissi\u00a0in old literature, is said to have originated in the temples of Odisha \u2013 an eastern coastal state of\u00a0India. The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text\u00a0 Natya Shastra , where it is referenced as the regional style Odra Magadhi. Its existence in antiquity is evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of\u00a0Kalingan temples,\u00a0and archeological sites related to\u00a0Hinduism,\u00a0Buddhism\u00a0and\u00a0Jainism. Odissi performances have expressed narratives and imagery related to Hindu deities as Jaganath, \u00a0Shiva\u00a0and\u00a0Surya, as well as goddesses (Shaktism)."

    "description": "This panel features Afrotectopia founder Ari Melencinao and speakers from the African American Caucus, Disability Caucus, Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, and Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies program in a cross-community dialogue about shared advocacy and connected futures. Event will take place within the George Segal Gallery, located on the fourth floor of the Red Hawk Deck parking garage. Admission is free, open to the public. \n \u00a0 \n \n \n ABOUT THE EXHIBITION \n September 23 \u2013 December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Black Metal \u00a0originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n The Age of Black Metal \u00a0builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way. \n The Age of Black Metal \u00a0invites all to imagine the futures that Black culture can build, if given space to expand without limit. \n Ari Melenciano \u00a0has cultivated an expansive practice within the arts, technology, design, culture, and pedagogy. Her natural ability to combine many disciplines reveals their interconnectedness and reimagines their conventions for new possibilities. Her art practice ranges from using AI through both critical and imaginative lenses, to sound design using botanical data. Her work has been exhibited around the world from Dubai's Museum of the Future to the Studio Museum in Harlem. She's a frequent international public speaker, and occasionally designs and teaches courses at New York University, Hunter College, Parsons, and the Pratt Institute. \n Afrotectopia \u00a0is a social institution cultivating boundless innovation at the nexus of art, design, technology, and culture. Founded in 2018 by NYU ITP graduate student Ari Melenciano, Afrotectopia began as a highly cross-disciplinary conference cultivating a vibrant community of industry and cultural pioneers. For years, Afrotectopia hosted a variety of programming that bridged connections between emerging technologies, Black culture, and racial equity."

Featuring legendary guests Jerry Douglas, Sam Bush, and Stuart Duncan, the record showcases soaring harmonies, heartfelt ballads, and music that speaks to our shared humanity. From the electrified drive of \u201cThis Is Me\u201d to the moving grace of \u201cBetter Angels,\u201d Nefesh Mountain offers songs that uplift and inspire\u2014serving as a beacon of light in divided times. \n \u00a0 \n To join us, be sure to pick up your free student ticket from the Alexander Kasser Theatre box office or our mobile box office in the student center lobby, Tuesday - Thursday, 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and show your student ID at the PEAK desk in the lobby when you arrive for a surprise gift from PEAK."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n The Age of Black Metal \u00a0builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

    "description": "Experience two distinct works by acclaimed songwriter and performer Gabriel Kahane in one unforgettable day.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n In this duo of intimate solo musical plays, composer Gabriel Kahane blends songwriting and storytelling for a singular, poignant theatrical event. Book of Travelers recounts the strangers he met on a 9,000-mile train journey through a divided America, and Magnificent Bird chronicles a year he spent entirely off-line, and the unexpected turbulence of living quietly. Performed on alternating nights, these two concept albums offer a relentless self-inquiry, and a searing portrait of a world in flux.\u00a0 To join us, be sure to pick up your free student ticket from the Alexander Kasser Theatre box office or our mobile box office in the student center lobby, Tuesday - Thursday, 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and show your student ID at the PEAK desk in the lobby when you arrive for a surprise gift from PEAK. \n \u00a0 \n Hailed as \u201cone of the finest songwriters of the day\u201d by The New Yorker, Gabriel Kahane is a musician and storyteller whose work spans the theater, club, and concert hall. Highlights of the 2024-25 season include a return to the New York stage in a production at Playwrights Horizons, performances at the Philharmonie de Paris, Wigmore Hall, and the Concertgebouw with fellow composer/performer Caroline Shaw, the premiere of a clarinet concerto for Anthony McGill, a solo debut with the Orchestre National de Lyon, and Kahane\u2019s San Francisco conducting debut in Carla Kihlstedt\u2019s Twenty-six Little Deaths. Kahane's collaborators range from Phoebe Bridgers, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, and Sylvan Esso, to the Danish String Quartet, Roomful of Teeth, and Attacca Quartet. As a writer, he has been published by The New Yorker online and The New York Times; a newsletter and collection of essays on music, literature, and politics can be found at\u00a0 gabrielkahane.substack.com . \n \u00a0 \n 4:00 pm Magnificent Bird \n Run Time: \u00a074 minutes, no intermission. \n \u00a0 \n Magnificent Bird, is an intimate reflection on a year of self-imposed isolation during which the artist set out to write a song every day. With contributions from Andrew Bird, Chris Thile, Amelia Meath (Sylvan Esso), and Pulitzer Prize- winning composer Caroline Shaw, this collection explores the delicate balance between personal introspection and global crises. It\u2019s a vivid musical snapshot of life during a tumultuous period, offering both a personal and universal meditation on modern-day existence. Based on Kahane\u2019s fifth LP. \n \u00a0 \n 7:00 pm - Book of Travelers \n Run Time: \u00a070 minutes, no intermission \n \u00a0 \n In Book of Travelers, Gabriel Kahane embarks on a journey across the United States, exploring the intersections of American identity and personal connection through the people he meets along the way. This powerful and emotional piece blends folk, classical, and pop influences to create a nuanced reflection on contemporary life in America. The work is a poignant and intimate exploration of what it means to traverse a country at a crossroads."
