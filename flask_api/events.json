    "description": "Written by Aaron Posner Sort of Adapted from The Seagull by Anton Chekhov \n Directed by Cristina Angeles \n An aspiring young director rampages against the art created by his mother\u2019s generation. A nubile young actress wrestles with an aging Hollywood star for the affections of a renowned novelist. And everyone discovers just how disappointing love, art, and growing up can be. In this irreverent, contemporary, and very funny remix of Chekhov\u2019s The Seagull, Aaron Posner stages a timeless battle between young and old, past and present, in search of the true meaning of it all. Original songs composed by James Sugg draw the famously subtextual inner thoughts of Chekhov\u2019s characters explicitly to the surface. Stupid F*cking Bird will tickle, tantalize, and incite you to consider how art, love, and revolution fuel your own pursuit of happiness. \n Sat, Apr 26 @ 2:00 PM & 7:30 PM Thu, May 1 @ 7:30 PM; Fri, May 2 @ 7:30 PM; Sat, May 3 @ 2:00 PM & 7:30PM \n \u00a0 \n I acknowledge that RSVPing to this event does not substitute a physical ticket for entry.  I understand I must acquire a physical ticket at The Alexander Kasser Theater Box Office before show time."

This Chicago-based performance collective masterfully merges shadow puppetry, cinematic techniques, sound effects, and live music to deliver a hauntingly unique experience unlike anything you have witnessed before. The ingenious blend of Mary Shelley's biography and her iconic creation, Frankenstein, offers a fresh perspective on the beauty and horror of creation. \n By intertwining the real-life and fictional narratives of Shelley, Victor Frankenstein, and Frankenstein\u2019s Monster, Manual Cinema intricately showcases how family, community, and education can shape personhood\u2014or destroy it by their absence. Don't miss out on this haunting interpretation of a classic! \n Court Theatre presented the World Premiere of Frankenstein in Chicago, November 2018. Frankenstein had its New York premiere at the Public Theater\u2019s Under the Radar Festival in January 2019 and its international debut in Scotland at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2019. \n Recommended for ages 12 and up. \n This production includes loud sounds, flashing lights and haze. \n Tickets are prepaid for undergraduate students with valid ID for more information\u00a0 click here"
