The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."
