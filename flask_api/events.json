    "description": "Experience two distinct works by acclaimed songwriter and performer Gabriel Kahane in one unforgettable day.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n In this duo of intimate solo musical plays, composer Gabriel Kahane blends songwriting and storytelling for a singular, poignant theatrical event. Book of Travelers recounts the strangers he met on a 9,000-mile train journey through a divided America, and Magnificent Bird chronicles a year he spent entirely off-line, and the unexpected turbulence of living quietly. Performed on alternating nights, these two concept albums offer a relentless self-inquiry, and a searing portrait of a world in flux.\u00a0 To join us, be sure to pick up your free student ticket from the Alexander Kasser Theatre box office or our mobile box office in the student center lobby, Tuesday - Thursday, 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and show your student ID at the PEAK desk in the lobby when you arrive for a surprise gift from PEAK. \n \u00a0 \n Hailed as \u201cone of the finest songwriters of the day\u201d by The New Yorker, Gabriel Kahane is a musician and storyteller whose work spans the theater, club, and concert hall. Highlights of the 2024-25 season include a return to the New York stage in a production at Playwrights Horizons, performances at the Philharmonie de Paris, Wigmore Hall, and the Concertgebouw with fellow composer/performer Caroline Shaw, the premiere of a clarinet concerto for Anthony McGill, a solo debut with the Orchestre National de Lyon, and Kahane\u2019s San Francisco conducting debut in Carla Kihlstedt\u2019s Twenty-six Little Deaths. Kahane's collaborators range from Phoebe Bridgers, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, and Sylvan Esso, to the Danish String Quartet, Roomful of Teeth, and Attacca Quartet. As a writer, he has been published by The New Yorker online and The New York Times; a newsletter and collection of essays on music, literature, and politics can be found at\u00a0 gabrielkahane.substack.com . \n \u00a0 \n 4:00 pm Magnificent Bird \n Run Time: \u00a074 minutes, no intermission. \n \u00a0 \n Magnificent Bird, is an intimate reflection on a year of self-imposed isolation during which the artist set out to write a song every day. With contributions from Andrew Bird, Chris Thile, Amelia Meath (Sylvan Esso), and Pulitzer Prize- winning composer Caroline Shaw, this collection explores the delicate balance between personal introspection and global crises. It\u2019s a vivid musical snapshot of life during a tumultuous period, offering both a personal and universal meditation on modern-day existence. Based on Kahane\u2019s fifth LP. \n \u00a0 \n 7:00 pm - Book of Travelers \n Run Time: \u00a070 minutes, no intermission \n \u00a0 \n In Book of Travelers, Gabriel Kahane embarks on a journey across the United States, exploring the intersections of American identity and personal connection through the people he meets along the way. This powerful and emotional piece blends folk, classical, and pop influences to create a nuanced reflection on contemporary life in America. The work is a poignant and intimate exploration of what it means to traverse a country at a crossroads."

    "description": "The  CSAM Science Teaching Program \u00a0holds\u00a0 biweekly meetings  that are open, welcoming, and inclusive! Any student curious about science teaching is invited to join us. Each meeting highlights a theme related to science education, from classroom strategies to career pathways, and offers students opportunities to connect with mentors, explore internships, and gain real-world experience working with teachers and children. Students are encouraged to  bring a guest  who may also be interested in exploring science teaching. \n These gatherings help us build a strong  community of support , where students encourage one another, share experiences, and access valuable opportunities such as  scholarships, paid internships, and mentoring  from advanced peers and in-service science teachers. Whether you are just beginning to explore the idea of teaching or already on the path toward certification, these meetings are a place to grow, learn, and belong."
