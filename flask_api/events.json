This exhibition will feature 3 sections of ISII course:  Threads of Us - Origins,   Pathways , and  New Horizon.  This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

    "description": "The Department of Sociology and Research on Interdisciplinary Global Studies (RIGS) present: A Reverse Time Capsule: What Unpacking Youth Futures Tells Us About Our Present \n \u00a0 \n Dr. Ruszczyk will offer a framework for how youth craft futures that integrate climate change with other considerations-and discuss implications for how these futures shape our present. Speaker: Prof. Stephen Ruszczyk\u00a0 Moderator: Prof. Timothy Gorman\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \n \n This research explores how young people in the Global South envision their futures in the context of the social challenges posed by climate change. Based on preliminary multi method research with Ecuadorian youths, findings indicate that many foresee adverse societal impacts from a changing climate and doubt the government's capacity to respond effectively to intersecting crises. Although group dialogues generated more optimistic and collaborative visions, individualistic strategies especially migration-predominated. These results suggest an urgent need for educational and civic spaces where young people can engage in collective reflection and envision shared pathways toward more just and sustainable futures. \n \u00a0 \n RSVP Here"

This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

Admission is free, open to the public. \n \u00a0 \n Segal Gallery \n Tuesday \u2013 Friday, 12 \u2013 4 pm \n \u00a0 \n Kasser Lobby \n Monday \u2013 Friday, 12 \u2013 6 pm \n \u00a0 \n We're also open on select Saturdays of the month and  by appointment . \n \u00a0 \n About the Exhibition: \n On view through December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Black Metal  originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

We can provide each other with community care!\u00a0 \n If you are coming as an Ally here are a few ways to be an ally to the disabled community: 1) Check your own internalized ableism. 2) Understand that not every disability is visible to you. 3) If you notice inaccessibility, speak up! Advocate for us. 4) Attend events that center disabled voices. 5) If a person in your life has a disability, take the time to learn about it. 6) Make mistakes, apologize, and learn from them. 7) Consume some media (made by disabled people) about disability. \n Meetings will be held online via Zoom"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

    "description": "The College of Humanities and Social Sciences is launching a new AI  Distinguished Speaker Series \u2014a yearlong exploration of how artificial intelligence is reshaping human systems, knowledge, and society. Designed to be inclusive and engaging, the series will bring thought leaders to campus who not only explain emerging technologies but also invite students and the wider community into critical conversations about their impact. By blending expert insight with student-centered formats, the series aims to spark new ways of learning, questioning, and participating in AI\u2019s future. \n The Truth of the Matter in the Age of Generative AI,  with Tina Eliassi-Rad, PhD \n Abstract We live in the age of algorithmically infused societies where human and algorithmic behavior are intertwined. Consider generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT and Gemini). Their use across a broad spectrum of our society is undeniable. How can we shape their use to improve our society? As it stands, such tools often increase epistemic instability in our society. Generative AI tools, for example, are not experts in any field and are prone to falsehoods (a.k.a. hallucinations) and adversarial attacks, yet they are treated like experts. The relationship between a person and a generative AI tool is also exaggerated by the sense of familiarity one feels when using such tools. The lack of effective oversight and accountability for this technology exacerbates these issues. How can we govern a technology that is mutating so rapidly? A digitally savvy public is an essential part of the solution. \n Speaker Bio Tina Eliassi-Rad is a Professor of Computer Science and  The Inaugural Joseph E. Aoun Chair at Northeastern University . She is also a core faculty member at  Northeastern\u2019s Network Science Institute . In addition, she is an external faculty member at the  Santa Fe Institute  and the  Vermont Complex Systems Institute . Prior to joining Northeastern, Tina was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University; and before that she was a member of technical staff and principal investigator at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Tina earned her Ph.D. in Computer Sciences (with a minor in Mathematical Statistics) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her research is at the intersection of data mining, machine learning, and network science. She has over 150 peer-reviewed publications (including a few best paper and best paper runner-up awards); and has given over 300 invited talks and 14 tutorials. \n Tina\u2019s work has been applied to personalized search on the World-Wide Web, statistical indices of large-scale scientific simulation data, fraud detection, mobile ad targeting, cyber situational awareness, drug discovery, democracy and online discourse, and ethics in machine learning. Her algorithms have been incorporated into systems used by governments and industry (e.g., IBM System G Graph Analytics), as well as open-source software (e.g., Stanford Network Analysis Project). Tina received an Outstanding Mentor Award from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science in 2010, became an ISI Foundation Fellow in 2019, was named one of the  100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics  in 2021, received  Northeastern University\u2019s Excellence in Research and Creative Activity Award  in 2022, was awarded the  Lagrange Prize in 2023 , and was elected  Fellow of the Network Science Society  in 2023. \n View her  website  or  LinkedIn ."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

    "description": "Embark on your own interstellar voyage in  The Age of Black Metal  by Afrotectopia. Admission is free, open to the public. \n \u00a0 \n Segal Gallery \n Tuesday \u2013 Friday, 12 \u2013 4 pm \n \u00a0 \n Kasser Lobby \n Monday \u2013 Friday, 12 \u2013 6 pm \n \u00a0 \n We're also open on select Saturdays of the month and  by appointment . \n \u00a0 \n About the Exhibition: \n On view through December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Black Metal  originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

In January 2020, Montclair State became an official  Swipe Out Hunger Organization \u00a0campus partner. The university has once again teamed up with our resident dining provider, Gourmet Dining, to continue with The Swipe Out Hunger program encompassing both campuses, Montclair and Bloomfield, this semester. \n Every Montclair State University or Bloomfield College student who is enrolled in a block meal plan (excluding unlimited meal plan holders) will be able to designate up to two (2) swipes per semester to the meal donation program. This drive will be active from October 20 until November 22. No additional meal swipes will be accepted after this date for the Fall 2025 semester.  Fill out this form  to make a difference!"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

Originally representing the unity of the thirteen colonies forming a single nation, the phrase expanded to encapsulate the idea that we can be a single people with varied backgrounds and histories. In both ways, this motto has often been more aspiration than description. \n In this final lecture, President Koppell explores what makes us one nation. Is it simply a legal definition, a shared heritage or commitment to a set of ideals? How do we function as a unified nation when the framers fractured power purposely? What are the features of the U.S. that have bonded communities and institutions together in the face of divisive forces? \n Event is open to all"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

We can provide each other with community care!\u00a0 \n If you are coming as an Ally here are a few ways to be an ally to the disabled community: 1) Check your own internalized ableism. 2) Understand that not every disability is visible to you. 3) If you notice inaccessibility, speak up! Advocate for us. 4) Attend events that center disabled voices. 5) If a person in your life has a disability, take the time to learn about it. 6) Make mistakes, apologize, and learn from them. 7) Consume some media (made by disabled people) about disability. \n Meetings will be held online via Zoom"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

    "description": "Experience two distinct works by acclaimed songwriter and performer Gabriel Kahane in one unforgettable day.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n In this duo of intimate solo musical plays, composer Gabriel Kahane blends songwriting and storytelling for a singular, poignant theatrical event. Book of Travelers recounts the strangers he met on a 9,000-mile train journey through a divided America, and Magnificent Bird chronicles a year he spent entirely off-line, and the unexpected turbulence of living quietly. Performed on alternating nights, these two concept albums offer a relentless self-inquiry, and a searing portrait of a world in flux.\u00a0 To join us, be sure to pick up your free student ticket from the Alexander Kasser Theatre box office or our mobile box office in the student center lobby, Tuesday - Thursday, 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and show your student ID at the PEAK desk in the lobby when you arrive for a surprise gift from PEAK. \n \u00a0 \n Hailed as \u201cone of the finest songwriters of the day\u201d by The New Yorker, Gabriel Kahane is a musician and storyteller whose work spans the theater, club, and concert hall. Highlights of the 2024-25 season include a return to the New York stage in a production at Playwrights Horizons, performances at the Philharmonie de Paris, Wigmore Hall, and the Concertgebouw with fellow composer/performer Caroline Shaw, the premiere of a clarinet concerto for Anthony McGill, a solo debut with the Orchestre National de Lyon, and Kahane\u2019s San Francisco conducting debut in Carla Kihlstedt\u2019s Twenty-six Little Deaths. Kahane's collaborators range from Phoebe Bridgers, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, and Sylvan Esso, to the Danish String Quartet, Roomful of Teeth, and Attacca Quartet. As a writer, he has been published by The New Yorker online and The New York Times; a newsletter and collection of essays on music, literature, and politics can be found at\u00a0 gabrielkahane.substack.com . \n \u00a0 \n 4:00 pm Magnificent Bird \n Run Time: \u00a074 minutes, no intermission. \n \u00a0 \n Magnificent Bird, is an intimate reflection on a year of self-imposed isolation during which the artist set out to write a song every day. With contributions from Andrew Bird, Chris Thile, Amelia Meath (Sylvan Esso), and Pulitzer Prize- winning composer Caroline Shaw, this collection explores the delicate balance between personal introspection and global crises. It\u2019s a vivid musical snapshot of life during a tumultuous period, offering both a personal and universal meditation on modern-day existence. Based on Kahane\u2019s fifth LP. \n \u00a0 \n 7:00 pm - Book of Travelers \n Run Time: \u00a070 minutes, no intermission \n \u00a0 \n In Book of Travelers, Gabriel Kahane embarks on a journey across the United States, exploring the intersections of American identity and personal connection through the people he meets along the way. This powerful and emotional piece blends folk, classical, and pop influences to create a nuanced reflection on contemporary life in America. The work is a poignant and intimate exploration of what it means to traverse a country at a crossroads."
