An animal is  conscious  whenever there is something it feels like to be that animal. Today, most believe that at least some nonhuman animals are conscious. For example, most think there is something it\u2019s like to be a cat. Cats presumably have experiences associated with sight, hearing, and smell. It also seems likely that they feel pain and experience pleasure. However, things become less clear and more controversial when it comes to animals outside of the class of mammals. Over lunch, we will explore which other animals have experiences, whether there are nonconscious animals, and how it might be possible for us to know. \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 What is P4L? Students, professors, and other philosophy enthusiasts close-read and discuss a few great passages of philosophy. \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 Who\u2019s invited? No preparation or previous knowledge of philosophy is needed. Everyone is welcome! \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 Should I bring anything? Bring a beverage, and if you're hungry, bring your actual lunch."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

Admission is free, open to the public. \n \u00a0 \n Segal Gallery \n Tuesday \u2013 Friday, 12 \u2013 4 pm \n \u00a0 \n Kasser Lobby \n Monday \u2013 Friday, 12 \u2013 6 pm \n \u00a0 \n We're also open on select Saturdays of the month and  by appointment . \n \u00a0 \n About the Exhibition: \n On view through December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Black Metal  originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

In January 2020, Montclair State became an official  Swipe Out Hunger Organization \u00a0campus partner. The university has once again teamed up with our resident dining provider, Gourmet Dining, to continue with The Swipe Out Hunger program encompassing both campuses, Montclair and Bloomfield, this semester. \n Every Montclair State University or Bloomfield College student who is enrolled in a block meal plan (excluding unlimited meal plan holders) will be able to designate up to two (2) swipes per semester to the meal donation program. This drive will be active from October 20 until November 22. No additional meal swipes will be accepted after this date for the Fall 2025 semester.  Fill out this form  to make a difference!"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

Originally representing the unity of the thirteen colonies forming a single nation, the phrase expanded to encapsulate the idea that we can be a single people with varied backgrounds and histories. In both ways, this motto has often been more aspiration than description. \n In this final lecture, President Koppell explores what makes us one nation. Is it simply a legal definition, a shared heritage or commitment to a set of ideals? How do we function as a unified nation when the framers fractured power purposely? What are the features of the U.S. that have bonded communities and institutions together in the face of divisive forces? \n Event is open to all"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

We can provide each other with community care!\u00a0 \n If you are coming as an Ally here are a few ways to be an ally to the disabled community: 1) Check your own internalized ableism. 2) Understand that not every disability is visible to you. 3) If you notice inaccessibility, speak up! Advocate for us. 4) Attend events that center disabled voices. 5) If a person in your life has a disability, take the time to learn about it. 6) Make mistakes, apologize, and learn from them. 7) Consume some media (made by disabled people) about disability. \n Meetings will be held online via Zoom"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

Admission is free, open to the public. \n \u00a0 \n Segal Gallery \n Tuesday \u2013 Friday, 12 \u2013 4 pm \n \u00a0 \n Kasser Lobby \n Monday \u2013 Friday, 12 \u2013 6 pm \n \u00a0 \n We're also open on select Saturdays of the month and  by appointment . \n \u00a0 \n About the Exhibition: \n On view through December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Black Metal  originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n \u00a0 \n The Age of Black Metal  builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

    "description": "Experience two distinct works by acclaimed songwriter and performer Gabriel Kahane in one unforgettable day.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n In this duo of intimate solo musical plays, composer Gabriel Kahane blends songwriting and storytelling for a singular, poignant theatrical event. Book of Travelers recounts the strangers he met on a 9,000-mile train journey through a divided America, and Magnificent Bird chronicles a year he spent entirely off-line, and the unexpected turbulence of living quietly. Performed on alternating nights, these two concept albums offer a relentless self-inquiry, and a searing portrait of a world in flux.\u00a0 To join us, be sure to pick up your free student ticket from the Alexander Kasser Theatre box office or our mobile box office in the student center lobby, Tuesday - Thursday, 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and show your student ID at the PEAK desk in the lobby when you arrive for a surprise gift from PEAK. \n \u00a0 \n Hailed as \u201cone of the finest songwriters of the day\u201d by The New Yorker, Gabriel Kahane is a musician and storyteller whose work spans the theater, club, and concert hall. Highlights of the 2024-25 season include a return to the New York stage in a production at Playwrights Horizons, performances at the Philharmonie de Paris, Wigmore Hall, and the Concertgebouw with fellow composer/performer Caroline Shaw, the premiere of a clarinet concerto for Anthony McGill, a solo debut with the Orchestre National de Lyon, and Kahane\u2019s San Francisco conducting debut in Carla Kihlstedt\u2019s Twenty-six Little Deaths. Kahane's collaborators range from Phoebe Bridgers, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, and Sylvan Esso, to the Danish String Quartet, Roomful of Teeth, and Attacca Quartet. As a writer, he has been published by The New Yorker online and The New York Times; a newsletter and collection of essays on music, literature, and politics can be found at\u00a0 gabrielkahane.substack.com . \n \u00a0 \n 4:00 pm Magnificent Bird \n Run Time: \u00a074 minutes, no intermission. \n \u00a0 \n Magnificent Bird, is an intimate reflection on a year of self-imposed isolation during which the artist set out to write a song every day. With contributions from Andrew Bird, Chris Thile, Amelia Meath (Sylvan Esso), and Pulitzer Prize- winning composer Caroline Shaw, this collection explores the delicate balance between personal introspection and global crises. It\u2019s a vivid musical snapshot of life during a tumultuous period, offering both a personal and universal meditation on modern-day existence. Based on Kahane\u2019s fifth LP. \n \u00a0 \n 7:00 pm - Book of Travelers \n Run Time: \u00a070 minutes, no intermission \n \u00a0 \n In Book of Travelers, Gabriel Kahane embarks on a journey across the United States, exploring the intersections of American identity and personal connection through the people he meets along the way. This powerful and emotional piece blends folk, classical, and pop influences to create a nuanced reflection on contemporary life in America. The work is a poignant and intimate exploration of what it means to traverse a country at a crossroads."
