The exhibition will be presented in Finley Gallery & the adjoining Annex Galleries from February 24th through March 3rd, with a public reception on February 24th from 3:00pm until 4:30pm. \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across two sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The artists themselves collectively organized this public sharing of their work\u2014together they met the challenge of presenting a visual through line within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class, as reflected by the two exhibition subtitles:  From the Outside In , and  Divergence of Reactions .\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n From the Outside In  led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n \u00a0 \n From the Outside In  features diverse works of thirteen artists from Integrative Studio 2, providing an intimate glimpse into their personal memories, emotions, and cultural backgrounds. From larger than life to up close and personal, these exceptional works touch upon the wondrous human experience on a whole new level. \n \u00a0 \n Students: Marley Balkau, Sandra Benlian, Emily Carrasco Perez, Ibelis Feliciano, Lisette Flor, Nila Freeman, Lena Harrison, Jenny Hernandez, Chloe Hwang, Brianna Mariconda, Hannah Michelson, Yanilda Munoz, Yan Bing Tan \n \u00a0 \n Divergence of Reactions  led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n \u00a0 \n Divergence of Reactions  shares works made by a diverse group of growing artists. The artists cover a wide range of topics in their work, bravely sharing emotional themes such as anxiety, depression, and different forms of abuse. Additional elements the work addresses include beauty, sportsmanship, fragility of life and more - giving viewers a window into the artists personal experiences. \n \u00a0 \n Students: Ofelia Alves, David Arrigoni, Anandria Campbell, Kalee Chaudhry, Kaitlyn Ferguson, Andrew Frazier, Keith Melendez, Bridget Perez, Stanley Piercin, Shyeann Rapley, Francois Rivero, Swetha Sivakumar, Sam Wortche \n \u00a0 \n Integrative Studio II Student-led Exhibition Finley Gallery, Finley Hall Exhibition dates: Feb 24\u2013 March 3, 2026 Opening Reception: Tuesday, Feb 24, 2026, 3:00pm\u20134:30pm"

The exhibition will be presented in Finley Gallery & the adjoining Annex Galleries from February 24th through March 3rd, with a public reception on February 24th from 3:00pm until 4:30pm. \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across two sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The artists themselves collectively organized this public sharing of their work\u2014together they met the challenge of presenting a visual through line within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class, as reflected by the two exhibition subtitles:  From the Outside In , and  Divergence of Reactions .\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n From the Outside In  led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n \u00a0 \n From the Outside In  features diverse works of thirteen artists from Integrative Studio 2, providing an intimate glimpse into their personal memories, emotions, and cultural backgrounds. From larger than life to up close and personal, these exceptional works touch upon the wondrous human experience on a whole new level. \n \u00a0 \n Students: Marley Balkau, Sandra Benlian, Emily Carrasco Perez, Ibelis Feliciano, Lisette Flor, Nila Freeman, Lena Harrison, Jenny Hernandez, Chloe Hwang, Brianna Mariconda, Hannah Michelson, Yanilda Munoz, Yan Bing Tan \n \u00a0 \n Divergence of Reactions  led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n \u00a0 \n Divergence of Reactions  shares works made by a diverse group of growing artists. The artists cover a wide range of topics in their work, bravely sharing emotional themes such as anxiety, depression, and different forms of abuse. Additional elements the work addresses include beauty, sportsmanship, fragility of life and more - giving viewers a window into the artists personal experiences. \n \u00a0 \n Students: Ofelia Alves, David Arrigoni, Anandria Campbell, Kalee Chaudhry, Kaitlyn Ferguson, Andrew Frazier, Keith Melendez, Bridget Perez, Stanley Piercin, Shyeann Rapley, Francois Rivero, Swetha Sivakumar, Sam Wortche \n \u00a0 \n Integrative Studio II Student-led Exhibition Finley Gallery, Finley Hall Exhibition dates: Feb 24\u2013 March 3, 2026 Opening Reception: Tuesday, Feb 24, 2026, 3:00pm\u20134:30pm"

The exhibition will be presented in Finley Gallery & the adjoining Annex Galleries from February 24th through March 3rd, with a public reception on February 24th from 3:00pm until 4:30pm. \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across two sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The artists themselves collectively organized this public sharing of their work\u2014together they met the challenge of presenting a visual through line within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class, as reflected by the two exhibition subtitles:  From the Outside In , and  Divergence of Reactions .\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n From the Outside In  led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n \u00a0 \n From the Outside In  features diverse works of thirteen artists from Integrative Studio 2, providing an intimate glimpse into their personal memories, emotions, and cultural backgrounds. From larger than life to up close and personal, these exceptional works touch upon the wondrous human experience on a whole new level. \n \u00a0 \n Students: Marley Balkau, Sandra Benlian, Emily Carrasco Perez, Ibelis Feliciano, Lisette Flor, Nila Freeman, Lena Harrison, Jenny Hernandez, Chloe Hwang, Brianna Mariconda, Hannah Michelson, Yanilda Munoz, Yan Bing Tan \n \u00a0 \n Divergence of Reactions  led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n \u00a0 \n Divergence of Reactions  shares works made by a diverse group of growing artists. The artists cover a wide range of topics in their work, bravely sharing emotional themes such as anxiety, depression, and different forms of abuse. Additional elements the work addresses include beauty, sportsmanship, fragility of life and more - giving viewers a window into the artists personal experiences. \n \u00a0 \n Students: Ofelia Alves, David Arrigoni, Anandria Campbell, Kalee Chaudhry, Kaitlyn Ferguson, Andrew Frazier, Keith Melendez, Bridget Perez, Stanley Piercin, Shyeann Rapley, Francois Rivero, Swetha Sivakumar, Sam Wortche \n \u00a0 \n Integrative Studio II Student-led Exhibition Finley Gallery, Finley Hall Exhibition dates: Feb 24\u2013 March 3, 2026 Opening Reception: Tuesday, Feb 24, 2026, 3:00pm\u20134:30pm"

The exhibition is on view February 3 through May 3 in the George Segal Gallery. \n \u00a0 \n Curated by Sally Morgan Lehman, who has taught in the Department of Art and Design at Montclair and is owner and director of Morgan Lehman Gallery in New York City, Carpe Diem highlights the breadth of artistic practices fostered at Montclair and the lasting impact of its visual arts alumni. \n \u00a0 \n Nancy Pantirer \u201980 is a New York-based artist working primarily in large-scale abstract painting. Through abstraction, Pantirer invokes an ongoing dialogue between control and order versus freedom and randomness. Pantirer holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Hartford Art School at the University of Hartford, as well as a Master of Arts from Montclair State College. She further refined her craft through graduate coursework at Tufts University Museum School in Boston and Pratt University in New York. Her painting and sculpture have been exhibited throughout the country and can be found in collections such as the University of Hartford, as well as in corporate and private collections. Her studio is located in Tribeca, New York City, where she also founded 81 Leonard Gallery to uplift local emerging artists. \n \u00a0 \n Tiffany Perez \u201909 is a New Jersey-based artist whose work bridges realism and culture, exploring themes of connection and inviting viewers to engage with pieces that feel familiar, nostalgic, and deeply at home. A lifelong creator\u2014she began drawing at age two\u2014Tiffany studied advertising arts at Passaic County Technical Institute and later earned her BFA in Fine Arts (Drawing) from Montclair State University. Her practice spans tattooing, pottery, textured painting, and realism, but her featured series for this exhibition focuses on color-pencil Moka Pots\u2014symbolic pieces inspired by heritage and the shared comfort of home. Through familiar objects and rich detail, Tiffany creates art that resonates, invites reflection, and brings warmth into living spaces. She is also the owner of Ink Gallery Tattoo Studio in Fairfield, NJ, continuing her mission to create and uplift the community through art and tattoos.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n Maria Valdivia \u201924 is a painter dedicated to shining a spotlight on the often overlooked and under-appreciated aspects of people. Drawing inspiration from everyday people and community life, Maria\u2019s artwork celebrates the unique qualities in the human body. She skillfully captures the essence of her subjects, inviting viewers to pause and reflect on the beauty and resilience found in the ordinary. Maria\u2019s paintings serve as portals into the rich inner worlds of her subjects, encouraging viewers to bring their own interpretations and emotions to complete her evocative compositions. \n \u00a0 \n Together, they represent multiple generations of Red Hawks who shape the local, national and international creative landscape as artists, educators and cultural leaders."

The exhibition will be presented in Finley Gallery & the adjoining Annex Galleries from February 24th through March 3rd, with a public reception on February 24th from 3:00pm until 4:30pm. \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across two sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The artists themselves collectively organized this public sharing of their work\u2014together they met the challenge of presenting a visual through line within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class, as reflected by the two exhibition subtitles:  From the Outside In , and  Divergence of Reactions .\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n From the Outside In  led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n \u00a0 \n From the Outside In  features diverse works of thirteen artists from Integrative Studio 2, providing an intimate glimpse into their personal memories, emotions, and cultural backgrounds. From larger than life to up close and personal, these exceptional works touch upon the wondrous human experience on a whole new level. \n \u00a0 \n Students: Marley Balkau, Sandra Benlian, Emily Carrasco Perez, Ibelis Feliciano, Lisette Flor, Nila Freeman, Lena Harrison, Jenny Hernandez, Chloe Hwang, Brianna Mariconda, Hannah Michelson, Yanilda Munoz, Yan Bing Tan \n \u00a0 \n Divergence of Reactions  led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n \u00a0 \n Divergence of Reactions  shares works made by a diverse group of growing artists. The artists cover a wide range of topics in their work, bravely sharing emotional themes such as anxiety, depression, and different forms of abuse. Additional elements the work addresses include beauty, sportsmanship, fragility of life and more - giving viewers a window into the artists personal experiences. \n \u00a0 \n Students: Ofelia Alves, David Arrigoni, Anandria Campbell, Kalee Chaudhry, Kaitlyn Ferguson, Andrew Frazier, Keith Melendez, Bridget Perez, Stanley Piercin, Shyeann Rapley, Francois Rivero, Swetha Sivakumar, Sam Wortche \n \u00a0 \n Integrative Studio II Student-led Exhibition Finley Gallery, Finley Hall Exhibition dates: Feb 24\u2013 March 3, 2026 Opening Reception: Tuesday, Feb 24, 2026, 3:00pm\u20134:30pm"

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "The emergence of a highly competent bureaucracy is typically under appreciated, if not ignored, as an ingredient in the emergence of the American experiment. While government administrators are often derided as inefficient or even obstructionist, technocrats are responsible for making government work and offer policy continuity and expertise across administrations. Still, the growth of a large permanent bureaucracy challenges the notion of accountability grounded in democratic elections. By tracing historical developments and contemporary debates, this lecture focuses on the centrality of government administrative capacity in the American experiment, focusing on the tensions and collaboration between elected officials and professional bureaucrats. We will consider the role of independent government agencies that were established with the idea of partitioning regulatory functions from partisan pressure."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

    "description": "DJing is one of the original elements of Hip Hop and is often considered the first. Hip Hop began in the Bronx during the 1970s at community block parties, where DJs used turntables to bring people together through music. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc introduced breakbeats by looping the most rhythmic parts of records, creating the foundation for breaking and shaping how dancers and MCs interacted with the music. \n As Hip Hop evolved, DJing became the musical backbone of the culture. DJs provide the beats for MCing, set the tempo for dancers, and control the energy of Hip Hop spaces by reading the crowd and responding in real time. Through techniques like scratching, cutting, and beat juggling, DJs helped define Hip Hop\u2019s sound while preserving its history and passing down cultural knowledge. \n This class introduces the basics of DJing and how music shapes the dance experience. DJ Bascis will explain core concepts such as  tempo, rhythm, and song structure , helping students understand how music guides movement and energy on the dance floor. \n Participants will learn how DJs choose music, create smooth transitions, and adjust the vibe based on the room.\u00a0 \n Through simple examples and live demonstrations, students will build confidence in listening to music with intention. This can bewhether they are dancing, freestyling, or interested in DJing themselves. \n This class is designed for  beginners and college students , with no prior DJ or music experience required."

Let\u2019s stand together to end the cycle of silence\u2014because\u00a0 every voice matters, and every action counts. \n Denim Day is recognized internationally as a day of action and awareness, encouraging people to wear denim to challenge victim-blaming and educate others about sexual violence.\u00a0 This year, Denim Day falls on Wednesday, April 29, 2026. \n The University Police and\u00a0 Office of Advocacy & Outreach and the Office of Advocacy and Community Resilience , in partnership with over 30 campus and local community organizations, invites you to join us\u00a0 from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the Amphitheater \u00a0for a powerful awareness event honoring survivors and increasing awareness of available resources. \n Despite the\u00a0 gaps \u00a0that still exist in the criminal justice system, in resources, and in prevention education,\u00a0 we will move forward together \u00a0as a community. As part of this commitment, we will walk\u00a0 one mile around campus in solidarity with survivors."
