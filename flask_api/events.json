This exhibition will feature 3 sections of ISII course:  Threads of Us - Origins,   Pathways , and  New Horizon.  This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

This exhibition will feature 3 sections of ISII course:  Threads of Us - Origins,   Pathways , and  New Horizon.  This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

Art Forum is a speaker series featuring artists, designers, art historians, curators, and art critics from around the world presenting their work and ideas in an open forum.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The next speaker in this engaging series is Ellie Krakow, an interdisciplinary artist whose practice spans sculpture, drawing, and photography. Ellie will be discussing her art, process, and share insights into her latest work.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n Ellie Krakow\u2019s latest body of work features abstract figurative sculptures that merge human forms with elements inspired by medical instruments and hospital architecture. Exploring themes of vulnerability and intervention, her work examines how screening and treatment shape bodily experience, inviting reflection on the complex relationship between the individual, technology, and medical environments. \n \u00a0 \n Parallel to her studio practice, Krakow engages in text-based and curatorial projects that foster dialogue around themes such as bodily and environmental loss, mirroring as a site of transformation, and displaced or disabled communication. These projects have been presented and published through organizations including The Whitney Museum of American Art, VECTOR Artist Journal, Printed Matter, Thomas Hunter Project Space, Drain Magazine, Lookie Lookie, and Skowhegan Public Programs. \n \u00a0 \n Krakow earned her MFA from Hunter College and her BA through study at Yale University and the Rhode Island School of Design. She currently teaches sculpture and serves as the director of Mazmanian Gallery at Framingham State University. \n \u00a0 \n This speaker series is free and open to the public. \n \u00a0 \n Art Forum\u00a0 \n Monday, 10/13/25\u00a0 5:20pm-7pm \n Calcia Hall, Room 140"

This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

    "description": "This panel features Afrotectopia founder Ari Melencinao and speakers from the African American Caucus, Disability Caucus, Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, and Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies program in a cross-community dialogue about shared advocacy and connected futures. Event will take place within the George Segal Gallery, located on the fourth floor of the Red Hawk Deck parking garage. Admission is free, open to the public. \n \u00a0 \n \n \n ABOUT THE EXHIBITION \n September 23 \u2013 December 14, 2025 \n Segal Gallery and Kasser Lobby \n Black Metal \u00a0originated as a kitchen table art book that pushes the boundaries of space travel, science fiction, speculative design, Black culture, art, technology, and spirituality. The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n The Age of Black Metal \u00a0builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way. \n The Age of Black Metal \u00a0invites all to imagine the futures that Black culture can build, if given space to expand without limit. \n Ari Melenciano \u00a0has cultivated an expansive practice within the arts, technology, design, culture, and pedagogy. Her natural ability to combine many disciplines reveals their interconnectedness and reimagines their conventions for new possibilities. Her art practice ranges from using AI through both critical and imaginative lenses, to sound design using botanical data. Her work has been exhibited around the world from Dubai's Museum of the Future to the Studio Museum in Harlem. She's a frequent international public speaker, and occasionally designs and teaches courses at New York University, Hunter College, Parsons, and the Pratt Institute. \n Afrotectopia \u00a0is a social institution cultivating boundless innovation at the nexus of art, design, technology, and culture. Founded in 2018 by NYU ITP graduate student Ari Melenciano, Afrotectopia began as a highly cross-disciplinary conference cultivating a vibrant community of industry and cultural pioneers. For years, Afrotectopia hosted a variety of programming that bridged connections between emerging technologies, Black culture, and racial equity."

This exhibition will feature 3 sections of ISII course:  Threads of Us - Origins,   Pathways , and  New Horizon.  This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation.

Just what he means by self-love, and how he thinks self-love should be cultivated in childhood to make us virtuous and strengthen our ability to resist the corrupting influence of society is important to making sense of his theory. In this week's P4L we will read and discuss passages from the  Emile  not only to understand Rousseau's theory, but also to think critically about the possibilities and limitations of educating virtue today. \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 What is P4L? Students, professors, and other philosophy enthusiasts close-read and discuss a few great passages of philosophy. \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 Who\u2019s invited? No preparation or previous knowledge of philosophy is needed. Everyone is welcome! \n \u00a0 \n \u2022 Should I bring anything? Bring a beverage, and if you're hungry, bring your actual lunch."

This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

This exhibition will feature 3 sections of ISII course:  Threads of Us - Origins,   Pathways , and  New Horizon.  This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

This exhibition will feature 3 sections of ISII course:  Threads of Us - Origins,   Pathways , and  New Horizon.  This exhibition will be on view in Finley Gallery from October 07 to November 4, 2025.\u00a0 The opening reception is Tuesday, Oct. 7 from 2:30-4:30pm.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n The ISII exhibition is the culmination of a six-week journey shared by visual arts majors across three sections of Integrative Studio II. Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

Using the pi\u00f1ata as a point of origin for their investigation, the artists delved deeply into the subject to expand their understanding of its history, materiality, and cultural significance. Building on this initial research, they created artworks across media exploring a range of themes, including construction, deconstruction, regeneration, and transformation. The student-artists collectively organized this public sharing of their work, together they met the challenge of presenting a visual throughline within the shared gallery spaces while still highlighting the unique voices of each class section. \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 01:   Pathways   led by Professor Jess Blaustein \n Andy Bermudez, Christian Campoverde, Rose Perez Cruz, Duy-Minh Do, Steven Jackson, Trevor Jennings, Will Kliment, Valerie Luxama, Tasir Plant, Luz Plata, Emmanuella Ponzio, Daniel Portillo, Denilson Raez, Shyeann Rapley, Fabrizio Rufasto, Giacomo Valerin \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 02:  Origins   led by Professor Simone Couto \n Edwin Acevedo, Mari Ahmed, Chez Amos, Rebecca Atwood, Lloyd Zheng, Veronica Avignone, Sarena Campos, Emily Garces, Keaoh Gonzalez, Katelin Guaman, Aj Malabunga, Jenna Mcdonough, Teiona Mcnair, Angeline Ortiz, Dante Ricci, Javier Salas, Ashly Solorzano \n \u00a0 \n SECTION 03 :  New Horizons   led by Professor Genevieve Lowe \n Timothy Andras, Janelsy Caceres, Marisol Coliente-izelo, Catalina Ferraro, Matthew Ferraro, Dylan Forbes, Alexa Grasso, Amanda Lerner, Keita Mcfarlane, Melanie Medina, Jeremiah Molin, Kevin Pena, Rosie Santos, Swetha Sivakumar, Diana Valdes, Beyza Yildiz \n \u00a0 \n Don\u2019t miss your chance to see the work of our talented Art & Design students!"

The book emerged from an Afrotectopia-led incubator, in collaboration with MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative and NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program. The project features contributions from artists Jordan Caldwell, Kordae Jatafa Henry, Jeremy Kamal, and Ari Melenciano. \n The Age of Black Metal \u00a0builds upon the foundational ideas of the book and translates the text into a fully immersive experience for visitors to explore each conceptual chapter\u2013from metaphysical training manuals, botanical consciousness, and self-alignment protocols\u2013through participatory installations. The exhibition is set centuries in the future, imagining a timeline where society has been profoundly shaped by the principles of Black Metal. Ultimately, visitors will not only bear witness to the societal effects of Black Metal, but also leave transformed in some way."

    "description": "The Latin phrase \u201cE pluribus unum\u201d (Out of many, one) is the motto on the Great Seal of the United States. Originally representing the unity of the thirteen colonies forming a single nation, the phrase expanded to encapsulate the idea that we can be a single people with varied backgrounds and histories. In both ways, this motto has often been more aspiration than description. \n In this final lecture, President Koppell explores what makes us one nation. Is it simply a legal definition, a shared heritage or commitment to a set of ideals? How do we function as a unified nation when the framers fractured power purposely? What are the features of the U.S. that have bonded communities and institutions together in the face of divisive forces? \n Event is open to all"

    "description": "Experience two distinct works by acclaimed songwriter and performer Gabriel Kahane in one unforgettable day.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n In this duo of intimate solo musical plays, composer Gabriel Kahane blends songwriting and storytelling for a singular, poignant theatrical event. Book of Travelers recounts the strangers he met on a 9,000-mile train journey through a divided America, and Magnificent Bird chronicles a year he spent entirely off-line, and the unexpected turbulence of living quietly. Performed on alternating nights, these two concept albums offer a relentless self-inquiry, and a searing portrait of a world in flux.\u00a0 To join us, be sure to pick up your free student ticket from the Alexander Kasser Theatre box office or our mobile box office in the student center lobby, Tuesday - Thursday, 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and show your student ID at the PEAK desk in the lobby when you arrive for a surprise gift from PEAK. \n \u00a0 \n Hailed as \u201cone of the finest songwriters of the day\u201d by The New Yorker, Gabriel Kahane is a musician and storyteller whose work spans the theater, club, and concert hall. Highlights of the 2024-25 season include a return to the New York stage in a production at Playwrights Horizons, performances at the Philharmonie de Paris, Wigmore Hall, and the Concertgebouw with fellow composer/performer Caroline Shaw, the premiere of a clarinet concerto for Anthony McGill, a solo debut with the Orchestre National de Lyon, and Kahane\u2019s San Francisco conducting debut in Carla Kihlstedt\u2019s Twenty-six Little Deaths. Kahane's collaborators range from Phoebe Bridgers, Paul Simon, Sufjan Stevens, and Sylvan Esso, to the Danish String Quartet, Roomful of Teeth, and Attacca Quartet. As a writer, he has been published by The New Yorker online and The New York Times; a newsletter and collection of essays on music, literature, and politics can be found at\u00a0 gabrielkahane.substack.com . \n \u00a0 \n 4:00 pm Magnificent Bird \n Run Time: \u00a074 minutes, no intermission. \n \u00a0 \n Magnificent Bird, is an intimate reflection on a year of self-imposed isolation during which the artist set out to write a song every day. With contributions from Andrew Bird, Chris Thile, Amelia Meath (Sylvan Esso), and Pulitzer Prize- winning composer Caroline Shaw, this collection explores the delicate balance between personal introspection and global crises. It\u2019s a vivid musical snapshot of life during a tumultuous period, offering both a personal and universal meditation on modern-day existence. Based on Kahane\u2019s fifth LP. \n \u00a0 \n 7:00 pm - Book of Travelers \n Run Time: \u00a070 minutes, no intermission \n \u00a0 \n In Book of Travelers, Gabriel Kahane embarks on a journey across the United States, exploring the intersections of American identity and personal connection through the people he meets along the way. This powerful and emotional piece blends folk, classical, and pop influences to create a nuanced reflection on contemporary life in America. The work is a poignant and intimate exploration of what it means to traverse a country at a crossroads."
